Pharmacological Basis of ACE Inhibitors in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)

1. Mechanism of Action of ACE Inhibitors

ACE inhibitors work by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is primarily located in the lungs and vascular endothelium. This enzyme is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). 

When ACE is inhibited, there is a significant reduction in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin I is produced when renin cleaves angiotensinogen, and normally ACE would convert this to the active form, angiotensin II. By preventing this conversion, ACE inhibitors reduce the levels of angiotensin II in circulation, which is important because angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone release.

The reduction in angiotensin II leads to decreased aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone normally acts on the kidneys to promote sodium and water retention. When aldosterone levels are reduced, there is less sodium and water retention, which helps reduce blood volume and consequently reduces cardiac workload.

ACE inhibitors also affect bradykinin metabolism. ACE is responsible for breaking down bradykinin, so when ACE is inhibited, bradykinin levels increase. This leads to vasodilation, which is beneficial, but can also cause side effects like dry cough in some patients.

2. Effects on Heart and Aldosterone

By reducing aldosterone levels, ACE inhibitors cause a decrease in blood volume. This happens because the kidneys retain less sodium and water when aldosterone is low. The reduced blood volume means less preload on the heart, which helps improve symptoms in heart failure patients.

ACE inhibitors improve cardiac output by reducing both preload and afterload. The reduction in fluid retention decreases preload, while the vasodilation from reduced angiotensin II decreases afterload. This allows the failing heart to pump more efficiently. Clinical studies have shown that patients on ACE inhibitors experience reduced symptoms of heart failure including less shortness of breath and improved exercise tolerance.

3. Direct Effects of Angiotensin II on Vessels and Heart

Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor. By reducing its levels, ACE inhibitors cause vasodilation throughout the body. This vasodilation reduces afterload, which is the resistance the heart must pump against. Lower afterload means the heart doesn't have to work as hard, reducing cardiac workload and oxygen consumption.

The decrease in peripheral vascular resistance that results from reduced angiotensin II levels leads to lower blood pressure. This is beneficial in heart failure because it reduces the stress on the failing heart and helps prevent further cardiac damage.

4. Remodeling Effects

Cardiac remodeling refers to changes in the structure and function of the heart that occur in response to injury or stress. In heart failure, the heart often becomes enlarged and the walls thicken (hypertrophy). There is also increased fibrosis, where normal heart muscle is replaced with scar tissue.

ACE inhibitors help prevent this remodeling process. They do this by reducing the levels of angiotensin II, which is known to promote myocyte hypertrophy and stimulate fibroblast activity. By blocking these effects, ACE inhibitors help prevent the heart from becoming more damaged over time.

Long-term studies have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF. Multiple large clinical trials have shown reduced hospitalizations and improved survival rates in patients taking ACE inhibitors compared to placebo.
