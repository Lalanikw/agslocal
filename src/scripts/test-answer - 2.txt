Pharmacological Basis of ACE Inhibitors in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)

1. Mechanism of Action of ACE Inhibitors

ACE inhibitors work by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is primarily located in the lungs and vascular endothelium. This enzyme is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). 

When ACE is inhibited, there is a significant reduction in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Angiotensin I is produced when renin cleaves angiotensinogen, and normally ACE would convert this to the active form, angiotensin II. By preventing this conversion, ACE inhibitors reduce the levels of angiotensin II in circulation, which is important because angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone release.

The reduction in angiotensin II leads to decreased aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone normally acts on the kidneys to promote sodium and water retention. When aldosterone levels are reduced, there is less sodium and water retention, which helps reduce blood volume and consequently reduces cardiac workload.

ACE inhibitors also affect bradykinin metabolism. ACE is responsible for breaking down bradykinin, so when ACE is inhibited, bradykinin levels increase. This leads to vasodilation, which is beneficial, but can also cause side effects like dry cough in some patients.
