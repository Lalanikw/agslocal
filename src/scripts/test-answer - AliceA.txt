Pharmacological Basis of ACE Inhibitors in Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)

ACE inhibitors are a cornerstone therapy in the treatment of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) due to their multifaceted effects on the cardiovascular system.
1. Mechanism of Action of ACE Inhibitors
ACE inhibitors work by blocking the angiotensin-converting enzyme, which is primarily located in the lungs and vascular endothelium. This enzyme is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Angiotensin I is produced when renin cleaves angiotensinogen, and normally ACE would convert this to the active form, angiotensin II. By preventing this conversion, ACE inhibitors reduce the levels of angiotensin II in circulation, which is important because angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of aldosterone release.
The reduction in angiotensin II leads to decreased aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone normally acts on the kidneys to promote sodium and water retention. When aldosterone levels are reduced, there is less sodium and water retention, which helps decrease blood volume and cardiac preload.
ACE is also responsible for breaking down bradykinin, so when ACE is inhibited, bradykinin levels increase. This leads to vasodilation, which is beneficial, but can also cause side effects like dry cough in some patients.
2. Effects on Heart and Aldosterone
By reducing aldosterone levels, ACE inhibitors cause a decrease in blood volume. This reduction in preload is beneficial in heart failure as it reduces the workload on the failing heart. ACE inhibitors improve cardiac output by reducing both preload and afterload. The reduction in blood volume decreases preload, while vasodilation reduces afterload. Clinical studies have shown that patients on ACE inhibitors experience reduced symptoms of heart failure including less shortness of breath and improved exercise tolerance.
When aldosterone is low, the kidneys retain less sodium and water, which further contributes to the decrease in blood volume and helps prevent fluid overload and pulmonary congestion.
3. Direct Effects of Angiotensin II on Vessels and Heart
Angiotensin II is a powerful vasoconstrictor. By reducing its levels, ACE inhibitors cause vasodilation throughout the body. This reduces systemic vascular resistance and afterload. Lower afterload means the heart doesn't have to work as hard, reducing cardiac workload and oxygen consumption.
The decrease in peripheral vascular resistance that results from reduced angiotensin II levels leads to lower blood pressure. This is particularly important in heart failure, where elevated blood pressure increases the work the heart must do to pump blood. The reduction in afterload allows the weakened heart to pump more effectively.
4. Remodeling Effects
Cardiac remodeling refers to changes in the structure and function of the heart that occur in response to injury or stress. In heart failure, the heart often becomes enlarged and the walls thicken (hypertrophy). There is also increased fibrosis, where normal heart muscle is replaced with scar tissue. ACE inhibitors help prevent this remodeling process.
Angiotensin II promotes both hypertrophy and fibrosis. By blocking these effects, ACE inhibitors help prevent the heart from becoming more damaged over time. This is crucial for long-term outcomes in HFrEF.
Long-term studies have demonstrated that ACE inhibitors reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF. Landmark trials such as CONSENSUS and SOLVD have shown that ACE inhibitor therapy leads to improved survival rates and reduced hospitalizations for heart failure exacerbations.
